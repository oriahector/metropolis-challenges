# Paper participations page made with Vue 3 + Vite + Typescript + Pinia + Jest

## Built With :hammer:

- [Vue](https://vuejs.org) - "A progressive, incrementally-adoptable JavaScript framework for building UI on the web."
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) - "A build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects"
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) - "An open-source language which builds on JavaScript, adding static type definitions."
- [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) - "Vue Router is the official router for Vue. js. It deeply integrates with Vue. js core to make building Single Page Applications with Vue."
- [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/) - "The succesor of Vuex, it allows you to share a state across components/pages"
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/es-ES/) - JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.

- Additionally I added vite-svg-loader for easier SVG imports.
